/**
 * Strips MFM — Misskey Flavoured Markup — down to plain text.
 *
 * The Misskey counterpart to `stripDiscordMarkdown()`, and needed for the same
 * reason: a note's raw text carries markup the client expands, so quoting it
 * verbatim puts `$[jelly …]` and `<center>` in the picture.
 *
 * Parsing goes through `mfm-js`, Misskey's own parser, rather than a local
 * approximation. MFM has enough corners — `$[fn …]` re-parses its contents so
 * functions nest, `<center>` is a block that only counts at the start of a
 * line, code and maths are verbatim — that matching the reference
 * implementation is worth the dependency. What is left here is only the walk
 * from its AST back down to text.
 *
 * Deliberately kept rather than stripped:
 *
 * - `:name:` custom emoji, drawn as-is — the caller decides whether to draw
 *   it, so there is nothing here to resolve
 * - `@user` and `@user@host` mentions — unlike Discord, MFM writes these as
 *   the readable name already, so there is nothing to resolve
 * - `#hashtag`, and a bare URL, for the same reason

/**
 * The node types MFM treats as blocks, each of which owns its own line.
 *
 * The parser consumes the newline that separates two blocks, since there it
 * is syntax rather than content. Flattening without putting it back would run
 * the lines together — `あ\n<center>ね</center>` would come out as `あね` —
 * so a break goes back wherever a block meets a neighbour. Text inside one
 * paragraph is untouched: the parser keeps those newlines itself.
